1.  `APIRouter` is used to modularize and organize routes in a FastAPI application, providing better code structure, maintainability, and reusability as the application grows in complexity.
2.  FastAPI will automatically generate and expose the OpenAPI documentation for our API at the specified path (`/openapi.json`).
3.  Path operator function (as it is associated with a specific path and HTTP method)
4.  `app.include_router(api_router)` integrates the routes defined in `api_router` into the main FastAPI application, making those routes accessible through the application.
5.  The `if __name__ == "__main__":` check in a Python script is used to determine whether the script is being run as the main program or if it's being imported as a module into another script.

    Title: FastAPI Recipe API
    
    Summary:
    The provided code defines a simple FastAPI application with a single endpoint that returns a "Hello, World!" message. It also includes a router to organize API routes.
    
    1. Imports:
        - Imports FastAPI and (1) APIRouter from the FastAPI framework.
    
    2. App Initialization:
        - Creates a FastAPI app instance named app.
        - Sets the app's title as "Recipe API" and specifies the OpenAPI documentation URL.
    
    3. API Router Initialization:
        - Creates an API router instance named api_router using APIRouter().
    
    3. Root Endpoint:
        - Defines a root endpoint using the @api_router.get decorator.
        - The endpoint returns a dictionary with a "msg" key and the value "Hello, World!".
        - Specifies a 200 status code for a successful response.
    
    4. Include Router in App:
        - Includes the api_router in the main app using the app.include_router(api_router) statement.
    
    5. Debugging Configuration:
        - Checks if the script is being run as the main module (__name__ == "__main__").
        - If true, runs the FastAPI app using the uvicorn server for debugging purposes.
        - Configures uvicorn to run on host "0.0.0.0" and port 8001, with a log level of "debug".
    
    Usage:
    The FastAPI app serves a single endpoint ("/") that responds with a "Hello, World!" message.
    The app can be run locally for debugging using the provided if __name__ == "__main__" block.
    
    Note:
    The provided code is a basic example and can be extended to include more complex API routes and functionality.
